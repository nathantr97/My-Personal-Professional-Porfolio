# My-Personal-Professional-Porfolio

## Description

The idea of this project was to create a portfolio webpage where I can present and showcase my projects
and applications as a Full Stack Developer. This portfolio webpage is a great opportunity for me to review, practice and apply what we recently learned to a real life scenario. In addition, I had to do quite a bit of researching online and debugging the webpage for errors. Throughout this project, I learned that it's always good to take a step back and try to solve one issue at a time.
